\subsection{The Byzantine merchant}
\label{sec:appendix:moj:byzantine}

Byzantium was an ancient city in modern-day Turkey, now called Istanbul. In 988 the Varangian Guard was formed by Emperor Basil II. This gave many Viking warriors the opportunity to join an elite guard for the Byzantine Emperor. Harald Hardrada was a great leader of the Varyags, as they were known.
