Wood
A Viking carpenter was called a smithr. The waste wooden cores left over from making the cups are popular among children because they can use them as spinning tops.
Chest
Price =  35.29 silver.
Most Viking homes had a wooden chest which the family would keep all of their valuable possessions locked inside.
Bucket
Price =  17.64 silver.
Buckets would have been made out of planks of wood and bound with metal hoops. Barrels and tubs were also made in this way.
Cup
Price =  0.44 silver.
A pole lathe was a contraption that was powered by way of a treadle and used to make cups. The best wood for making cups was ash, alder and maple because they would not crack like oak.
Ironing Board
Price =  1.32 silver.
Clothes would be ironed by rubbing a smooth, slick stone over them against a wooden or whalebone smoothing board whilst they were still wet. A method not too different from ironing today!
Game Board
Price =  2.20 silver.
Viking games like hnefatafl were played a lot to pass the time at home. Not only were they entertaining but they also taught children strategy and logic skills.
Bowl
Price =  0.44 silver.
Bowls were made from wood and sometimes clay. Well-preserved Viking bowls could easily be mistaken for being modern.
Ladle
Price = 0.88 silver.
Ladles were used to serve drinks into cups for everyday use and drinking horns for cold alcoholic drinks at feasts. A Viking woman was found buried with a ladle and a bucket in Skei, Norway.
